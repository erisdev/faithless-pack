# FAITHLESS

i wanted to make a new texture pack. [my friend][Q-LUM] is helping.

## HISTORY
### 0.1 – 2017-08-25

first release. very unfinished.

many of the blocks here were based on the original 32×32 textures from my previous attempt at a texture pack. water, lava and nether portal textures are lifted straight from that pack totally unaltered except for some palette tweaks.

## CREDITS
### [eris][]

that's me! any textures otherwise uncredited are probably my doing.

### [Q-LUM][]

* soul ~~sand~~ squirm
* general color advice

they're also working on a sci-fi webcomic called [electrum][] that you should definitely read.
